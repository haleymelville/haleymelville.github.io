# Book Review: Who Ordered This Truckload of Dung?
##  by Ajahn Brahm
I’ve read this book a few times. I wasn’t ready for all the lessons the first time, and I wasn’t ready the second time. But somehow, I always get what I’m looking for when I crack it open. Collected over a thirty year time period, Ajahn Brahm shares stories that sit in your mind until your soul is ready to digest them. If you’re feeling spread too thin, this book is definitely worth a read! 
### How it reads: 
Ajahn Brahm organizes these stories by emotions, which, no surprise, were the chapter titles. In fact, the table of contents was where I had my first “a-ha!” moment. Titles like Perfection and guilt, Fear and pain, and Freedom and humility. It dawned on me that these emotions we’re all feeling, are all connected. We can’t fully understand fear without fully understanding pain and we don’t know what freedom feels like until we’ve experience humility.

Each chapter offers six to thirteen different stories that are truly engaging. Not only is it more interesting to read a story than a lesson or rule book, it is much easier for me to translate into my own life. 

While there is some tie in from chapter to chapter (hello human emotion!), the organization makes it easy to pick up and read the chapter you need at the moment….just don’t forget to go back and read the rest!
### Why it’s worth it: 
The feels...with humor! This man is hilarious. I love that even when I’m tearing up thinking about my own guilt or fear, he can make me laugh. This was one of the first books that allowed me to really look at myself without judging myself. Something I’ve known about myself for a long time is the fear I have of how others view me, what they think of me. I know how silly this sounds and I know I should ‘stop’. But, I never knew how. In the Freedom and humility chapter, there is a very short, very powerful story titled “the idiot”. Eleven sentences kick started a shift in my thinking...and made me laugh at myself.

The metaphors! The title itself has an amazing story attached to it in the Creating Happiness chapter. The story, in a nutshell, shows us that we are all capable of carrying around our problems and fears and worries; our dung. Even if you are one who can keep your own dung under control, someone else may bring their dung to your home on a daily freaking basis.  Or maybe, you’re covered in other people’s dung after a long day at work and it’s incredibly hard to get off before you get home. And now, your car, your porch and your lawn are covered in dung. What’s your next step? What are you going to do with all of this...dung? Now, I think a lot about what I’m doing with the dung in my life.
### Who it’s for: 
Something for everyone! I’d gift this to just about anyone; pre teens, teenagers, twenty-somethings, parents, and grandparents! In fact, there is an amazing poem included by a 9 year old! The real gift will be the conversations that are bound to happen after they’ve read it.

I picked this book up because at the time, I was feeling like I was drowning at work and at home...we’ve all been there. I was tired and tired of feeling sorry for myself. I needed this reminder that life is not easy, but I’m not the only one working through this mess. We’re all on a journey, some farther ahead and some parked in a lot somewhere. But, we’re all failing forward.
