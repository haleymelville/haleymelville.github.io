# The Zen Parenting Radio Podcast
My biggest goal for this blog is sharing tools and tips to help you live the best life you can as a busy, possibly working, parent. For this reason, I feel it’s mandatory to mention podcasts. A few years ago, my husband introduced me to this world. If you have not discovered this magical land, please please take a moment and get lost in it. There are a billion apps and sites that offer podcasts: Apple Podcasts, Google Play Music, Spotify, Stitcher Radio, and the list goes on. Just do a quick search for topics you’re interested in and BOOM. Hundreds of ideas at your fingertips. There are a few I listen to regularly like [Parenting Mojo](http://yourparentingmojo.com/episodes/), and [The Moth](https://themoth.org/podcast). But, for a quick dive into podcasts, I wanted to share one I don’t go a week without listening: Zen Parenting Radio. [https://zenparentingradio.com/](https://zenparentingradio.com/)

## What’s it about: 
The hosts of Zen Parenting Radio are Cathy and Todd.  They are a married couple with three daughters of their own. Cathy is an author and therapist while Todd is a certified life coach. She has more of the emotional core while he is logical thinker so hey balance each other really well.  They cover a range of topics; some deeper than others, all focusing around relationships. A tag line from the site says “Creating conversations to encourage self-awareness, mindfulness, compassion, & connection.”

## Why it’s worth it:
I could list a hundred reasons, but I thought I’d share one specific episode that I’m actually living now as a parent of a 10 and 8 year old. Their recent episode titled “The Gift of Failure” takes a look at the ideas found in [Jessica Lahey’s book](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Failure-Parents-Children-Succeed/dp/0062299255).  (I haven’t read this one, but it is on my reading list!) I don’t know about you, but so often I receive unsolicited parenting advice that couldn’t be more polarizing in theory. After hearing it, I always jump into my mental hamster wheel and the self doubt begins: How do I know which one is ‘right’? Is there a right? The topic in this particular episode is no different: parents should allow space and opportunity for our kids to….drum roll….fail. Being a teacher and mother, I completely see the value in allowing children to make mistakes. That doesn’t make it easy though, and there is always the voice in my head that says, “But, there are times in our lives that we can and should help our children, right?” 

But when? How often? To what degree? Cue round two on the mental hamster wheel. 
Cathy and Todd’s response in this episode was such a relief: there is not one blanket rule.

How freeing is that? 

The couple goes on the discuss that as parents, our role not only involves teaching them responsibility, but also empathy. Children learn this just like everything else, by watching us.  While it may be easier to just say, “I subscribe not NOT bailing my kid out”, and never ever bring their missing lunch or homework or whatever it may be. What would I really be teaching them? How would I feel if a friend calls my child and asks “can you bring my coat that I left at the park?” and my child responds with, “nope, you shouldn’t have left it. Hopefully you’ll be more responsible in the future.” OUCH. 

While many of the topics will deal with parenting in some form or another, the core of the podcast is relationships and self awareness. In episode #380, Cathy speaks about the loss of her father. She references a few of the books and tools she’s used to move through the grieving process. Around the 47 minute mark, she references a beautiful quote from Ram Dass that has stuck with me, “we are all just walking each other home.” They discuss the need to just show up, not to ‘show’ them the way, but to just walk alongside them. (I rate this section about a two on the Number of Kleenex Scale, maybe more.) 

Towards the end, she discusses how those closest to her helped her through this process. This was big for me. I realized I don’t know how to act or what to say around someone that has just lost a loved one. “If you need anything, let me know.” is about as far as I get. But, having gone through a loss, I know that sometimes the sadness  can be so overpowering, I can’t tell you what I need because I don’t even know what I need, or don’t need, or even what day it is. 
## Who’s this for:
While the name suggests this podcast is ideal for current parents and for anyone thinking about becoming a parent, it is really for anyone looking for tools to better their own lives.
